squeeze-alexa
=============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/declension/squeeze-alexa.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/declension/squeeze-alexa)

`squeeze-alexa` is an Amazon Alexa Skill integrating with the Logitech Media Server ("squeezebox"). See the original [announcement blog post](http://declension.net/posts/2016-11-30-alexa-meets-squeezebox/), and the [follow-up with videos](http://declension.net/posts/2017-01-03-squeeze-alexa-demos/).

This is still **in beta**, so feedback and help with documenting welcome! Probably best to raise an issue first.

### Aims

 * Intuitive voice control over most common audio scenarios.
 * Low latency (given that it's a cloud service)
 * Decent security (hopefully!)


### Things it is not

 * Full coverage of all LMS features, plugins or use cases. It aims to be good at what it does.
 * A multi-user skill. This means: yes, you will need to set up Alexa and AWS developer accounts.
 * A native LMS plugin (at least, not currently). Yes, more server fiddling.
 * Easy to set up :scream:

I want one!
